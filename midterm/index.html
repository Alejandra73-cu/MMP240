                    Premiered on NBC on November 30, 2015. The series was created by Justin Spitzer, who served as an executive producer for four seasons. Starring America Ferrera (who also serves as an executive producer) and Ben Feldman (who also serves as a producer), it depicts the everyday lives of employees at the fictional Cloud 9 superstore, store number 1217, in St. Louis, Missouri. The ensemble and supporting cast features Lauren Ash, Colton Dunn, Nico Santos, Nichole Sakura, Mark McKinney, and Kaliko Kauahi. In December 2020, Ferrera announced that she would be leaving the show at the end of the sixth season. The series concluded on March 25, 2021.

                    The series primarily centers on Jonah (Ben Feldman), a college-educated new hire, and Amy (America Ferrera), a long-time employee who later becomes the store manager. Other key characters include the quirky and strict assistant manager Dina (Lauren Ash), the lovable and naive Garrett (Colton Dunn), and the ambitious but awkward Mateo (Nico Santos).
                    Throughout its six seasons, Superstore tackles workplace dynamics, corporate policies, labor issues, and social topics—all with a mix of humor and heartfelt moments. It’s often praised for its diverse cast, witty writing, and realistic portrayal of retail life.
