    <li>Unsweetened Applesauce</li>
    <li>Vegan Buttermilk (made from scratch)</li>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
       <li> Whisk together dry ingredients: This is your flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Then set aside. (NOT The Sugar) </li>
      <li>Cream together the vegan butter and sugar: Your vegan butter should be lighter in color than when you started. This is a good sign that the sugar has emulsified into the butter and created air pockets that help the cake to rise. Then weâ€™ll add in the remaining wet ingredients and making everything together.</li>
      <li>Once the wet ingredients are combined, add in the flour in increments: Youâ€™ll alternate between the vegan buttermilk and flour mixture, mixing gently or on low-medium speed until just combined.</li>
      <li>Pour the cake batter into your prepared cake pans and bake! You can use 8â€³ round cake pans, 6â€³ cake pans, or even do a 7â€³ if you have it ðŸ™‚ Bake until a toothpick comes out clean or by using the bounce back test.</li>
      </ol>

        <ul>I feel like this is such an underrated trick, and I talk about it a bit in my Vegan Baking 101 guide. I also now have an entire guide on how to make vegan buttermilk that will help you choose which dairy free milk to use!</ul>

           <ul> If youâ€™ve ever had a normal vanilla cake, then youâ€™ll know that incredibly sweet yet ever so subtle tang that comes along with a fluffy and moist cake. Thatâ€™s from the buttermilk. It also helps to give rise to the cake without drying it out.</ul>
            
            So since buttermilk isnâ€™t vegan, weâ€™ll have to make our own- but donâ€™t worry itâ€™s so simple!
            
            All youâ€™ll need to do is combine  your chosen dairy free milk with a little apple cider vinegar. Let the mixture sit for 5-7 minutes so that it can slightly curdle. Then use it in your recipe as you would regular buttermilk!</li>
      </ol>
  <h3>Enjoy the cake!</h3>
